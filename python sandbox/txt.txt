Wakes up in the middle of the ditch, in the middle of the night
    Can see the spire of the temple at the top
    Never seen it from this angle
        tries to speak 
            cannot even whisper
                throat gone because of his screams

Reminisces the day in the morning
    His father was getting him ready
        Eyes beaming with pride
    Oils his tuft of hair
        now the tuft is missing
            they shaved it off
            slit his father's throat
            killed all the attendant priests and their families
                screams of people
                    his scream
    His ring
        his father's ring
            an heirloom that was more than 3000 years old
            broken by them
            thrown as if garbage
        broken hand
            pains
            he cries
        
Tries to get up
    load over him   
        pile of earth
            full of disgusting insects
                gnawing at him
    keeps fighting
        fails 
    anger builds
        vows revenge
    tries little by little
        frees other arm
        another foot
        finally cleans his chest
    his robe gone
        only his dhoti left
            was once white
            dirtier than the soil around him
    
Considers running back up
    falls immediately
        no food
        extremely tired
        extremely thirsty
    looks around
        sees very close to a stream
            the water is very muddy, not potable
            the stream that brought him down
                kept him alive
                joins hands to that stream
                    thanks the stream
            tries to find where it is coming from
            finds cleanest spot
                dunks himself
                water that was once cool, is now warm
                    fills him with some more anger
    
Sees the bottom village in the distance
    was never aware that there was a village there
        tries to go towards it
            collapses again

Hears a girls voice
    thinks of his goddess
        in her beautiful clothes
        smiling at him
        so fair, so elegant
    finds the direction of her voice and opens his eyes smiling 
        smile dies 
        is not the goddess 
    a girl goes with a wheelbarrow full of buckets of water
        pleads for water
            cannot speak
            girl hesitates, then says, "no one should beg for water"
        gives him water
        his eyes open to look at her properly
    he tells her his name, "Gaurav"
        cannot speak
    her name is "Kalika"
        he faints

wakes next to a fire
    thinks of everything as a bad dream
        thinks of the girl
            she was beautiful
                finds an old man hunched over his face
    looks at the house around
        small, but clean 
    cannot speak
        medicine in his mouth
            slowly dripping into his throat
    old man explains
        the girl brought him
            remove all her water
                put him in the wheelbarrow
                then brought him here
                went back to fill the water again
        Kalika is his granddaughter
    Gaurav tries to move his legs
        his foot is also gone
            plastered using some smelly stuff
        I did, says the old man
    he feels extremely indebted to this family
        he would call them up to live in the high city
        he feels very helpless
        he feels his anger rising
            his teachings his instinct is to hold back the anger
                he holds it back
                    his father's face comes to him  
                        he lets his anger come in full fury   
                        can barely move
                        extreme fever 
                        extreme anger
                            faints

Eventually the girl comes back
    caught fishes
        he is a vegetarian
        starts to cook with her old man
        he tries to make her laugh
            she never laughs
    food is about to be served
    old man leaves to another room
        can hear him praying murmuringly
            he recognises the tune, it is his father's tune
                he is praying to his goddess
            tears fill his eyes again
                he wipes it and looks around to see the girl looking at him
                    impassive
                    her eyes look too black
            he tries to speak
                forces the mouth contraption away
                    spits out green thick liquid on the floor next to his bed
                        the girl picks up a dirty cloth and sets it next to his face
                        and cleans the sick
            tries to speak again
                can speak but voice much hoarse
                    "Thank you"
                the girl nods
    "come have some food"
        "grandpa loves my fish, today I caught a big one"
        old man returns
    Gaurav struggling with his morals
        his good hand instinctively reaches for his tuft of hair
            it is gone
            considers, but doesn't relent
                eats only the rice and some chutney
    they eat in silence

(scene of his past)
    (how his family was attacked)
    (how his father was killed)
    (ow he was thrown in the pool of water, which carried him to the bottom of the mountain)

(scene of him speaking with the old man)
    (him fixing the small shrine in the house)
        (cleaning a yantra)
    (the old man tellin him about the girl)
        (a lot, lot of fury inside her)
        (her story)
    ("one of us actually deserves to be here" he means himself, but not his Kalika)
*


(scene of him stealing the sword for her)
    (enters the gated mansion and )

(scene of her going berserk over the mansion, with the sword)
    (breaks in the mansion)
    (absolute gore)
    (everyone terrified of her)
    (covered in blood)
    (kills everyone indiscriminately)
    (about to kill the servants)
    (Gaurav stops her)
        (even he is a bit scared of her)
    (they meet the mini boss - the leader who betrayed them)
        (philosophical arguments with him)
            (his son also present) - his son's name is Vasuki
                (he is sympathetic to Kalika)
        (she is let loose)
            (he tries to fight, stood no chance in front of her)
                (about to kill the son)
                    (Gaurav stops her)
    (they leave)
        (Kalika breaks down in his arms)
            (cries loudly)

(scene where Vasuki joins them)





(Gaurav's backstory)
(he is a monk, on the day of his initiation as the head priest, youngest head priest ever, they are attacked by some outsiders. his house is attacked, and his whole family is killed in front of him. his head is shaved, and clothes removed, and he is pushed from the mountain, falls in a stream, flows to where he wakes up.)

(Kalika's backstory)
(one of the lower leaders is corrupt, and helped the outsiders in
the girls family worked for the leaders
the girls brothers tried to warn higher up
killed by the leader 
the girl saw it
they had a younger sister too
she was given as a gift to the outsiders
she is dead too
the girl found her sister's earring)

(this is one of the stepping stones, that our heroic duo will overcome,
revenge of this is how Kalika starts trusting Gaurav)
    (add the scene of him stealing the sword for her, and giving it to her. And her going absolutely bloodsport using it, and he has to take her kicks to stop her from killings)
    ("let me take my revenge and I will do whatever you want from me. I will be your slave for the rest of my life, just let me take this revenge" - even she has the same ideals as him, and is asking for his permission to let them go, just for this instance)
    (also set up that she has to be the one who takes the revenge of the outsider leader, not him)
        (he cannot let his morals go, neither can she)
